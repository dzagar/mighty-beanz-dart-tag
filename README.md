App 2 - Mighty Beanz Dart Tag
Dana Zagar

This award-winning game is a simple tag game between two AI Mighty Bean looking fellas and you, the coolest blue Mighty Bean of them all. Use the WASD or up/down/right/left keys to move your player and tag / avoid tagging!

Built all the assets myself, downloaded the grass texture from Unity Asset Store.

Scoring is based on time that you are "it"; the higher your time, the worse you do. Like golf. Except time.
